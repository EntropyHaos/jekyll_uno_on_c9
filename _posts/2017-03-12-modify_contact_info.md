The `_config.yml` file is where your basic information that is shared across the site lives.

The theme offers several options for sharing contact info. You can configure them by creating a variable definition in the `_config.yml` file as such:

```yml
author:
  name: 'Benjamin Haos'
  email: benjaminhaos@gmail.com
  twitter_username: EntropyHaos
  #facebook_username: 
  github_username:  EntropyHaos
  linkedin_username:  benjaminhaos
```

If you comment out the variable, or simply do not include it, it will not display on the site.
